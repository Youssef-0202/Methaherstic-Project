Our goal was to transform the raw FSTM schedule into a structured format that our metaheuristic algorithm can understand.

The source data was a complex Excel file. The main challenge was that the data was stored in a visual grid with many merged cells. 

To solve this, I developed a Python script using the openpyxl library:
First, it identifies the rooms and their capacities.
Second, it parses the merged cells to extract 183 individual class sessions.

As a result, we now have three clean CSV files: Rooms, Groups, and Assignments. These are ready to be used by the algorithm.

To make our Hard Constraints (like Teacher Conflicts and Room Capacity) work correctly, we need the teacher IDs and student counts.
