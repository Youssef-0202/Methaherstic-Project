• Excel file missing teacher data - only has rooms, times, courses
• Excel file missing group size data - need student count per group

POINTS TO DISCUSS RE: MATHEMATICAL MODEL:
• Hard Constraints (H1-H5):
  - H1/H2/H3: Conflicts (Teacher, Group, Room)
  - H4: Capacity check (size_g <= cap_r)
  - H5: Room Type match (e.g., TP must be in Lab)
• Soft Constraints (S1-S3):
  - S1: Minimize gaps (windows)
  - S2: Load balancing for teachers
  - S3: Avoid early/late sessions
• Objective Function: f(S) = Σ wH·Hi + Σ wS·Sj (wH=1000, wS=1)
